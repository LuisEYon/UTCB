# Universal Timing Check Board (UTCB)
This repo acts as the digital storage of all associated developments (e.g. Circuit Design, Pictures, CAD) and related documentation to the "Universal Timing Check Board". This device acts as a sister companion to circuit testing for analog voltage checks and timing. Inspiration for board function and design is from previous revisions of an analog based brake system plausiblity device, however, this device is more general purpose and for my personal use. 


Image below shows a general esimate of how I intended the board to look like and inspired by (although to be at a much much smaller dimensional board footprint)

** Board Functionality ** 

- Check if an upper threshold is met. (0v to 12v)
    - Multichannel Comparator check
- Check if a lower threshold is met.
    - Multichannel Comparator check (0v to 12v)
- Check if mid threshold comparison between 2-4 signals is met. 
    - Mid-threshold voltage set via 2 - 8 potentiometers (0v to 12v)
- Drive a failure mode signal out from either signals (12v, 7.5v, 3.3v, 0v)
- Have RGB LEDs that glow based on what failure condition per signal is failed or if thereâ€™s a net pass. These are tied to comparators? Might be tricky. 
    - Red: Threshold failure
    - Orange: Timing Failure
    - Green: No Failure
    
** Board Connection Points ** 

Main PWR: 
- PWR through wall outlet (Expands to 12v and 7.5v option for logic) 
    - Needs AC to DC conversion with voltage step down.  
- Final PWR voltage needs to be regulated (Off the shelf chip) 

Signal Connections (For reading)
- Terminal block connection points (4P header) for direct wire feeds. 
- For signal voltage reading: Has ribbon cable attachment to breadboard for data collection (but no direct programmable element on-board). 
- For board debugging: Set test points to grip onto for PWR points, Comparator Outputs, and final failure outputs. 

** Purpose ** 

- Allows me to isolate analog logic voltages on an offboard device or PCB. 
- Allows me to clearly indicate where faulty logic is based on physical tuning via potentiometers. 

---> What to do next <---
Finish basic logic check circuitry for 5 signals. Need to find a comparator chipset rated for 12v and higher. 
Develop basic logic switch circuitry for determining if 3.3v, 5v, 7.5v, or 12v is being utilized for logic.
